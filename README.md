Play to earn app for oracle tools for players to earn yield based on decisional pathways chocen from a directionn of 255 matter.direct library, where players are recommended a crystal structure to uphold energetic forces based on bavais group numnbers. Some may not be ready, and it can create a type of decisional pathway, while this creates a practice playground for users (moderated) to execute on spiritual journeys. 

Adaptation from fluence calculator with crystal sumation to prevent javascript augmentation and true alchemical purity sourcing randomness from the collective nodes of thhe offchain fluence nodes, to computed structures with mina. 

Q: How to wield digital alchemy? An example of matter.direct investigate as a small sample.

## Things to consider when building on application for others
- timestamps, how long certain learning can take
- how you can improve documentation
 
```
Ex: Create an aqua file
implement a distribution using service config if needed
compile your aqua file to a distributon
```

Use Mina to compute the differences in utf / crystals, find the patterns. 
Create a relay timer to get the amount of time taken to make a decision as a stream. 

## Flow
- random relay
- present crystal capsule network
- choose path way
- exceute yield function

Tools Used:
- apwine (full)
- superfluid (not there yet)
- mina (wip)
- fluence (possible with a few more hours)

- worldcoin --> not now, let the bots compete against the humans
- matter.direct direction

## Physical Project Divination Tools:

Pre internet breakage:
- Icosehedron: Rolled a 4::> emperorship, name destiny number, web4, chesed, # of tools used for hackathon

Project energy prep:
- Icosehedron: Rolled an 8::> strength, infinities, home-energy destiny brought forth
- Tarot: Pulled a Hanged Man ::> dictating prophecy, higher vision
- Crystal: Pulled a Rose Quartz ::> representing empathy and venus, conjuring from the collective unconcious
